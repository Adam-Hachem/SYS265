This is my docker project, along with configuration files for the docker01 server itself.

For my project, I wanted to try to use MySQL instead of MariaDB for WordPress. This requires some customization to the compose.yml.

Additionally, I have changed the port that Wordpress will be accessible from from 80 to 8008.

Luckily, WordPress is not a wiki, it is a content management system. While it is absolutely possible to buid a wiki using WordPress, it is not specifically for this and you may have an easier time using more fitting solutions like MediaWiki.
